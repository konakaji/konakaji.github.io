&lt;p&gt;I strongly believe that utilizing the power of classical machine learning is the key to circumvent this situation. To show the significance of this possibility, we have recently posted the paper: [url]. 
In the paper, we propose the Generative Quantum Eigensolver (GQE) utilizing the generative model of quantum circuits 
and its pre-trainable Transformer implementation (GPT-QE).
