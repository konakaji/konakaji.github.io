We posted the paper on arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14811. 
The first paper since joining the Matter Lab! 
We have developed a higher-order randomized algorithm for Hamiltonian simulation. 
This algorithm achieves time complexity independent of the number of terms in the Hamiltonian, and the systematic error can be made exponentially small relative to the order parameter.

The Python code for the algorithm can be found here: https://github.com/konakaji/qswift.
