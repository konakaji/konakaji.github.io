I have been leading my research project involving more than ten people. 
It is very helpful that people with different expertises contribute to the project.
However, at the same time, a research project with such a number of people would easily diverge, 
so I have been thinking a suitable project structure. 


Each project, whether it is for industry or for research, has its pre-requisite - Different pre-requisite
leads to a different optimal project structure. Still, I believe some of the conditions are the same as long as we consider the theoretical research project involving 
many people. So I want to leave some of the know-hows I learned from this project in multiple posts.
In this post, I focus on the design of the meetings.  


In our case, we have biweekly regular meetings. In addition, temporal meetings are 
set based upon requirements.
