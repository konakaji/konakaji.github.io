I have recently received my Ph.D. in quantum computing, culminating my two-year academic pursuit. 
My journey began two years ago, inspired by the achievement of quantum supremacy, 
which sparked my interest in quantum computing. 
Initially, my goal was to develop practical applications in quantum computing, without a particular focus on an academic career post-Ph.D. 
However, my experiences have now inclined me towards contributing academically to this field, at least for the foreseeable future.

Therefore, I will continue my research endeavors. I'll be at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST) until August. Subsequently, in September, I will join the University of Toronto.
