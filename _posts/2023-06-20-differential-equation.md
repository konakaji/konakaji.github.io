The large condition number often becomes a bottleneck when solving differential equations on a quantum computer. 
We show that for a specific class of partial differential equations, which includes many practically important cases, the time complexity can be made independent of the condition number. 
This is achieved through the successful application of quantum wavelet pre-conditioning.
