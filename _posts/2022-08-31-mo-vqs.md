We posted a paper on arXiv, accessible here: https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13934. Many measurement optimization methods, such as classical shadow and derandomization, have been proposed for variational quantum optimization. 
However, applying these methods to variational quantum simulation (VQS) has posed significant challenges. Our paper introduces an algorithm designed to integrate measurement optimization into VQS. We provide both theoretical and numerical evidence to validate the effectiveness of these measurement optimization methods in this context.
