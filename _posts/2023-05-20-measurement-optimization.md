Estimating the expectation value of observables is a crucial subroutine in quantum computing and often serves as a bottleneck for the performance of many near-term quantum algorithms. Numerous studies have been conducted to reduce the number of measurements required for this task, offering various measurement schemes. 
In this paper, we introduce a new approach: the composite measurement scheme, which provides the algorithm to successfully combines existing measurement optimization methods.
